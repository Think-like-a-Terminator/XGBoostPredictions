üî• Risk Prediction Using XGBoost vs Deep Learning vs Decision Trees

This jupyter notebook pits three powerful algorithms ‚Äî XGBoost, Deep Learning, and Decision Trees ‚Äî against each other in a showdown to find the most effective model for predicting risk in subscriptions. This exploratory analysis and modeling aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, backed by real-world data.

The training, tuning, and evaluation of these models including feature importance.



üí° How Does XGBoost Work?

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting to optimize model performance. Here's how it works:

Base Learners: XGBoost starts with simple decision trees as base learners, iteratively improving their predictions.

Boosting Technique: The model improves its predictions by minimizing errors from previous iterations.

Regularization: XGBoost employs L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, which can be a common issue in complex models.

Scalability: It‚Äôs designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making it faster and more scalable than other algorithms.



üîß Why XGBoost Can Outperform Deep Learning and Decision Trees

1. Feature Engineering Superiority

XGBoost often outperforms Deep Learning models in structured/tabular data tasks (like risk prediction or binary classification), where deep learning might struggle to find the intricate patterns due to its reliance on neural networks, which excel in unstructured data like images or text. XGBoost handles:

Missing data and categorical variables efficiently.

Directly incorporates feature importance, making it more interpretable than deep learning.

2. Speed & Scalability

Compared to Decision Trees, which can be slower to train when grown very deep, XGBoost uses clever optimizations like:

Column Block Compression: Reducing memory usage and speeding up calculations.

Parallelized Execution: Trees in XGBoost can be built in parallel, making it incredibly fast on large datasets.

Leverage GPUs: with only one parameter setting, XGBoost can leverage GPU's.

3. Overfitting Control

While Decision Trees can overfit on complex datasets and Deep Learning can struggle with overfitting when trained too long, XGBoost has a built-in mechanism for handling overfitting:

Regularization and Shrinkage prevent the model from becoming too complex.

This ensures that XGBoost strikes a balance between bias and variance, providing better generalization compared to a pure decision tree model.

4. Interpretability
Unlike the black-box nature of Deep Learning, XGBoost offers great interpretability, it can retrieve the feature importance scores based on the weight (i.e., the number of times a feature is used to split data across all trees).



‚ö° The Power Showdown: XGBoost vs Deep Learning vs Decision Trees

Metric	XGBoost	Deep Learning	Decision Trees

Training Speed	‚ö° Fast	üê¢ Slower on tabular data	‚ö° Moderate

Overfitting Control	‚ö° High (Regularization)	üê¢ Moderate	üê¢ Prone to overfitting

Interpretability	‚ö° High (SHAP values)	üê¢ Low (Black box)	‚ö° Moderate

üí° Conclusion

In many risk prediction scenarios, XGBoost shines as a superior model due to its:

Ability to handle tabular data more effectively than deep learning.

Built-in regularization mechanisms.
